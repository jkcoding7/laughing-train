## System Requirements

The current version of JetUML is built with Java 21, the latest long-term support (LTS) release. To build JetUML, it is necessary to have the [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) version 21 and the jar files of [JavaFX](https://jdk.java.net/javafx21/) version 21 available. The JetUML code base is configured to build easily with [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org/), but use of this IDE is optional. To contribute code, it will be necessary to run the [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.org/) tool.

## Building the Application in Eclipse

1. Ensure that you meet the system requirements, including a working version of Eclipse.
2. In Eclipse, ensure that the JDK 21 is the default workspace JRE (_Window | Preferences | Java | Installed JREs_).
3. Create a new _user library_ called `JavaFX` that includes all the JavaFX 21 jar files. To create this library, access _Window | Preferences | Java | User Libraries_, select _New..._, enter the exact string `JavaFX`. Then, select this library, and click _Add External JARS..._, then find and select the jar files under the `lib` directory of your JavaFX download.
4. Import the [JetUML repo](https://github.com/prmr/JetUML.git) in Eclipse (_File | Import | Git | Projects from Git | Clone URI_). If you meet the system requirements, the project should build automatically.
5. To run JetUML, right-click on the project in the Package Explorer and select _Run As | Java Application_, selecting `JetUML` as the main file.
6. **If you are using a Mac**, to run the application, open the run configuration and make sure the checkbox "Use the -XstartOnFirstThread argument when launching with SWT" is not checked.

## Committing Code

1. All committed code must respect all the JetUML style guidelines. These are available as a [style file](../style/Style.xml) for the [Checkstyle Eclipse Plug-in](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/checkstyle-plug). Before committing code for JetUML, make sure to install the plug-in, activate it, and check for any warning.
2. All commits must be associated with an issues using an issue tag as the first token in the commit comment, using the format `[$NB]` where `NB` is the issue number. For example, [`[#519] Add constraint for connection to notes`](https://github.com/prmr/JetUML/commit/6af09b1289153cb5fd0aa5b0683da77bca2e5e58).
3. Ensure that any new file includes the [copyright notice](#copyright-notice).
3. Ensure that all unit test pass.

## Packaging the Application

JetUML can be packaged as a self-contained application for Windows, Linux, and possibly Mac. This is done with the [jpackage tool](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/specs/man/jpackage.html) distributed with OpenJDK. 

### Windows

Run this from the git repo root (where `FXMODS` points to the JavaFX mods directory, e.g.,):

```
set FXMODS="C:\local\Java\javafx-jmods-21.0.2"
jpackage --module-path %FXMODS%;bin\jetuml --add-modules jetuml --module jetuml/org.jetuml.JetUML --app-version 3.6 --icon docs\JetUML.ico --win-shortcut --win-dir-chooser
```

### Linux

Run this from the git repo root (adjust paths as needed):

``` 
FXMODS=/usr/lib/jvm/javafx-jmods-21.0.2
JMODS=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-17-oracle-x64/jmods
jpackage --module-path $JMODS:$FXMODS:bin/jetuml --add-modules jetuml --module jetuml/org.jetuml.JetUML --app-version 3.7 --icon icons/jet.png 
```

### Mac

Run this from the git repo root (where `PATH_TO_FX_MODS` points to the JavaFX mods directory)

```
$JAVA_HOME/bin/jpackage -n JetUML --module-path $PATH_TO_FX_MODS:bin/jetuml --add-modules jetuml --module jetuml/org.jetuml.JetUML --app-version 3.4 --module jetuml/org.jetuml.JetUML --type pkg --icon docs/JetUML.icns
```
